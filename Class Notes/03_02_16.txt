Logic Programming

Objectives
  - CH 16
  - Introduction main concepts on Logic Programming
  - Explain basics of declarative calculus
  - Apply the LP concepts with Prolog

A.
  - Base logic statements and infers solutions
    = knowledge
        human(woman)
        woman(Maria)
        --human(Maria)?yes
  - Declarative
    = just describe solution
      Exp: sort(list)
        IMP -> how sol. (quicksort, inst sort,...)
        LP -> Describe solution
           -> sort(list, sorted) => permutation(list) and
           -> for any element j of sorted list
                j<j+1
                sort(list, sorded)
                sort(list, [1,2,4,5])
                --> cannot optimize
    = Advantage: Flexible. Ask different questtions
    = Disadvantage: does not optimize
  - Programming Logic Programming is writing a collection o ffacts and rules
  - Prolog only PL that is LP

B.
  - Propositions. Logic statements that may be true or not
  - Logic statements
    = Simple/atomic proposition
    = Composite statements
    = Infer statements

  - atomic
    = twoparts
      - functor
      - parameter list -> 1 parameter 1-tuple, 2 parameter 2-tuple
      woman(Maria)
      likes(Maria, dogs)

  - assignment
    aUb a or b
    a ^ b a and b
    a < b b is included in a
    a > b
    ! negation
  - Variables
    V for all -> Vx.woman(x)>human(x)
    E exist -> Ex.mother(mary, x)^male(x)
  - Clausal forms -> standardize statements
    A U A U V A M B1 ^ B2 ^ B3 ^...^B
        Then          If
    If all B's are true then at least one A is true
  - father(Louis, al) U father(Louis, violet) < (father(al,bob) U mother (violet, bob) U grandfather(Louis, Bob))
  - Horn clause
    = statements to left
      -> 1 -> evaluated
      -> None -> fact
      woman(Maria)
    = use logic proving theorems -> proving a theorem
