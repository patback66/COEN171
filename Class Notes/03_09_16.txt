Objectives
  - CH16 LP
    = Deficiencies in Prolog
    = Where is Prolog used
  - CH13 Concurrency
    = Explain the main concepts of concurrent programming

Deficiencies
  1)  Logic P. shouldn't be able to influence the execution time
    - But Prolog does allow you to do that
      = Order Statements
        male(bob).
        male(darren).
        male(david).
        ...
      = Evaluate solution tree

      ?male(X), parent(X, maria).
      ?parent(X,maria),male(x).

    - Goals:
      a,b,!,c.
        if c fails, do not redo a and b

      sort([],S):-S=1,!.

      sort(L,S):-perm(L,M),is_sorted(M,S),!.
      is_sorted

  2)  Negation
    x!=Y
      true
      Fail
    It is difficult to make prolog return false

  3)  Goal is based only on the DB
      Returns true is only valid for the DB
      Not a universal truth
    - Algorithms are difficult to optimize

Where is prolog?
  Nowhere, but elements
  - DataBase
    = SQL-Optimizer
  - natural Language Processor
    = Watson

Chapter 13: Concurrency
  - Concurrent -> At the same time
  - Concurrent Programming ->< features on PL that allows same time execution of the instruction
    = Java -> threads library
  - Parallel Programming
    = Get a program to run faster at scale
  - Distributed/Cloud Computing
    = Set of computers interconnected through the network
