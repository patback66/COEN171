Variables
  - Describe variables and their properties
  - explaining binding and scope
    - variable is related to cells in memory

Properties
  - name
    - seq of characters
      - C: start with _ or letter
        - {_,letter}{letter,digits}
        - How many: length of a line (255 char usually)
        - uses 63 char
          - 32 char for extern
        -  Java, c++, etc: how many? any
    - Case sensitive
      - naming convention
        - camelCase
        - lowercase
        - Hungarian
        - _
    - Reserved Word
  -   type
  - data/value
  - address
    - The same variable can have different addresses
      - Virtual Memory
      - Stack
      - C->pointer
    - That you can have different variables associated with the same address
      - int restrict *p;
  - scope
    - Global
      - C/C++: outside of main
      - Java:X Security
      - Python, Perl: Yes
    - Local
  - lifetime
  - binding
    - association
      - name->type
      - type->value
    - When does the binding happen?
      - Time
      - Static Time -> compile time
      - Dynamic Time -> run time

  1)  Name->type
    - Explicit
      - C: int a;
    - Implicit
      $a=7 //after being declared, can only have an integer
    - Type inference
      $a=7
      $a=[7,2,3]
    - dynamic
      - perl, python, matlab
      - flexible
      - slow
  2)  Type->value
    - Static
      - C: int static a;
    - Stack var
      -  when the func is on exec
        int f(int d) {
          int b;
          return b+d'
        }
    - Dynamic ->malloc/free || new/delete
