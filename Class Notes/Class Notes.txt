1 Midterm
Quizzes: Open book, open note, online, 3 retries

Objectives: CH 1

-Explaining why we need to study programming languages
-Explaininig main language categories
-Implementation methods

-Why we ahve so many programming Languages
	-	>100
	-	better express our algorithms/problems
	-	Speed
	-	Hardware compatability
		-	can be ensured by compiler
	-	Hardware/Operating System independent
	-	Different tasks
	-	Improve PL
	-	Cost

-Why PL
	-	Cover details of PL
	-	Prove if you know a PL "well" then learning another is easy

-How to Choose a PL?
	-	Easy to read
		-	Be able to debug
	-	Easy to write
		-	Syntax
			-	how clean is it?
		-	Interpreted or Compiled
	-	Cost
	-	Portability

-Categories of PL
	-	Imperative
		-	var, assignmentn, cond stm
		-	C, Assembly, Fortran, Basic, Python, 
		-	Many of the original PL
	-	Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
		-	C++, Java, Python, Ruby, PHP
		-	many modern PL
		-	Creates specific problems and solutions
	-	Functional Programming
		-	(Pure) doesn't declare variables
			-	everything is a function, operates on a function
			-	create a function, solve a function, return a function, operate on a set
		-	Lisp, Scala, 
		-	Good for scaling
		-	many have this sort of functionality
	-	Logic Programming
		-	Prolog
		-	Completely parallel
		-	built to try to immitate how humans think
	-	Concurrenct/Parallel
		-	Many have this - make use of multiple cores
		-	C (Pthread), Java, C++,
